        <p>
          In 1991, India faced a severe balance of payments crisis, which led to
          the introduction of major economic reforms:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Liberalization:</strong> Removing licensing requirements,
            reducing trade barriers
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Privatization:</strong> Disinvestment of public sector
            units, allowing private sector in more industries
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Globalization:</strong> Opening up to foreign investment,
            reducing import tariffs

          Answer: 2. Regulating the securities market

        <p className="text-sm mt-2">
          Explanation: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)
          regulates the securities market, not the RBI. The RBI is responsible
