        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">Example Question</h3>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Which of the following is NOT a component of the fiscal deficit?
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 mb-4">
          <li>Revenue deficit</li>
          <li>Capital expenditure minus non-debt capital receipts</li>
          <li>Market borrowings</li>
          <li>Grants to states for creating capital assets</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="font-semibold">Answer: 3. Market borrowings</p>
        <p className="text-sm mt-2">
          Explanation: Fiscal deficit is the difference between total
          expenditure and total non-borrowed receipts. It represents the
          borrowing requirement of the government. Market borrowings are a means
          to finance the fiscal deficit, not a component of it. The fiscal
          deficit includes revenue deficit and capital expenditure minus
          non-debt capital receipts.
